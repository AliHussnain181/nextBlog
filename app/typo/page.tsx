        <h2>The Importance of Good Typography</h2>
        <p>
          Good typography helps make content easy to read and understand, guiding users through the text with a clear visual hierarchy.

        <ul>
          <li>Enhanced readability with proper line height</li>
          <li>Improved structure with consistent padding and margins</li>
          <li>Better focus on key information, such as headers</li>
        </ul>
